CLicking on a box does not set it to focused

maybe have a boolean for set
	Once a y collision has been found, set "set" to true
	If set is true, 
		in the tick, do the setFunction
this needs to be changed to false again on rotation or slidemove


random needs to be set at the start of the os
or in a helper class?

checkpiece collision is not safe (will not check if out of bounds before accessing board bounds
